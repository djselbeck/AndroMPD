/**
 * This class is a base class for all derived handlers that talk to the MPD server.
 * There are three handlers for different tasks.
 * <p/>
 * - MPDCommandHandler - Issues all playback commands to the mpd server which are handled instantly.
 * - For example: play,pause,stop ...
 * <p/>
 * - MPDQueryHandler   - Handles all requests to the database and other state objects of the MPD server.
 * - For example: Album, artist, playlists, output list ...
 * - MPDStateMonitoringHandler - Monitors the state and notifies connected callback listeners in a certain
 * interval about changes in state. It uses the idle state of the MPDConnection
 * as a notification about changes at the server side.
 * <p/>
 * All handlers are static singletons and run in a new spawned thread. You can get the singleton via
 * an static method. Each handler has one MPDConnection object, that is used for talking to the mpd server.
